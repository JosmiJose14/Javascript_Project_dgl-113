## Proposal

- Reset button - contactus.html
Users who want to reset all the fields at once may find it useful if a reset button is included on the contactus page. I also think about including a confirmation dialogue box to prevent unintentional clicks.

- Submit button - contactus.html
Make sure that the contact page form's mandatory fields are accurately filled out by adding a validation feature. Also, additional text boxes for the phone number and email address should be added, and proper regex validation should be used to guarantee that the input is in the right format.

- Popup message - home.html
 While popups can be effective in grabbing users, onload of home page loads small pop-up that can be easily dismissed which communicatethe promo or discount to the user.

- Onhover effect - ourservices.html
By including an on-hover effect to the button, the user is made aware that when they click the services button on the service page, they may view detailed services.

- Image popout - home.html
Increasing the height and width of images on the home page and adding an on-focus effect.

- News icon - news.html
By including an add icon, users will be able to add news to the news page and have it appear in the news sections.
